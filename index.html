<h2>February 7-9: Brainstorming + <em>Pomes</em></h2>

<h3>Personal Project brainstorming</h3>
<p>
	<strong>My dad:</strong> Something involving the space station? News on launches? Sea things? He's a hug fan of marine history and ships.

	<strong>Both my parents:</strong> A history of Cuba. Family history? - Do I have enough info/memorabilia for this? (update: Dad's going to dig up old photos and letters from his Soviet Russia days).

	<strong>Cousin:</strong> She has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_degeneration">Macular Degeneration</a>. Maybe I can develop something specifically to help with this condition? A way for her to see important photos in an easier way?	Need to do additional research to see if there's any visual methods that can be used to help eyesight.
</p>

<h3>P<em>Pomes personalization</h3>

<p>
	I stuck to staying simple and just trying to make a travel diary with it, even though really I don't travel much. Originally I was trying to use the Instagram API to automatically populate images with the locations, but I got scared off by having to register with Instagram as a developer and give a reason in order to do it. For now I'm just e-mailing photos to myself and replacing them manually. I also had to get an Mazon S3 account in order to host my photos.

<h3>1. Concert setting</h3>

<img width="600" src="http://i328.photobucket.com/albums/l355/laura-guillen/tyler-sketch4_zpsgbf2mj23.jpg">
<p>Tyler seems quiet and introverted at first, but he enjoys going to live shows and he frequents them at least three times a month.
These ideas place him in a loud concert setting. The first being a background of a concert with strobe lights traveling the page, and the second is his card jumping up and down to msuic from the speakers.</p>

<h3>2. Pouring beer</h3>
<img width="600" src="http://i328.photobucket.com/albums/l355/laura-guillen/tyler-sketch1_zpsfukm7dwt.jpg">
<p>Tyler loves beer a lot so the background of the entire page with his card can fill with poured beer until he's completely immersed in it.</p>

<h3>3. Record Player</h3>
<img width="600" src="http://i328.photobucket.com/albums/l355/laura-guillen/tyler-sketch2_zpsi0iqnouf.jpg">
<p>Tyler enjoys collecting LPs and has a fairly large selection, so maybe his picture can turn into a record being played.</p>

<h3>4. Data loving + Meticulous</h3>
<img width="600" src="http://i328.photobucket.com/albums/l355/laura-guillen/tyler-sketch5_zpswwsg5kxt.jpg">
<p>Tyler also spends a lot of time working with data, so that can be shown with numbers raining down or his picture becoing pixelated.</p>

<p>He is also a very organized guy who makes lists and pays attention to detail, which is where the idea of a giant magnifying glass came from.
