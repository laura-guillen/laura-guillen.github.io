		<h2>March 22: Task List for Google Drive's API</h2>
			<p>

				I've gotten my cousin to test out Scanner Pro and to take note of her habits.<br>
				I know that she organizes by book>chapter>"pages" and does multiple pages at a time. She syncs automatically through the Scanner Pro app to Drive and organizes her folders in Scanner Pro.</li>
			<p>	

		<p>
			<strong>With Alec and Shaunalynn's help, I've managed to succesfully:</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>Authorize Google Drive's API to work with a Drive account(mine)</li>
				<li>Get the API to list a specific parent folder, then list its children.</li>
			</ul>	
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Immediate Next Steps:</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>Make sure that I can get two levels of children, not just one.</li>
				<li>Organize list so that it shows hierarchy of parent folder > child folder > files.</li>
				<li>Make file names linkable.</li>
				<li>Once the linked in clicked, get only rich text from the PDF file.</li>
			</ul>

		<h2>March 8: Digital Reader Next Step</h2>

		<p>
			After giving my presentation I got a received a lot of great feedback about the direction this project can go in. I thought about it some more and decided my current direction isn't the correct one to solve my cousin's needs.
		</p>

		<p>
			A new direction that was suggested and that seems very promising is using OCR to digitize what the user wants to read and then taking that and enhancing it to the needs of someone who is low vision.<br>
			I spoke extensively to my cousin and she was very excited about using OCR technology. I had her test out a few apps to see if any of them stood out, and she liked a couple.</p>

			<strong>NEXT STEP: Find a cloud API that stores the OCR'd text, then find out how to take that data and use it.</strong>

			<p>One of the apps my cousin like was <strong>Scanner Pro</strong>. It doesn't have the ability to use OCR, but it lets a user upload their photo(s) to Google Drive and have it use their OCR to get the text as an editable and readable file. Google Drive had the most accurate translation out of the four apps I tried, So it seemed like a good place to start.
			</p>

			<p>
				With a lot of help from Alec I was able to set up the code so that when the API loads it exports a specific file to plain text, so that instead of just listing out file names into a div it has the text inside of the file requested.
			</p>

			<img width="600" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/laurag/media/test-0224/OCR-text.png"><br><br>

			<strong>STEPS AFTER THAT?</strong>
			<ol>
				<li>Map the user flow of my app.</li>
				<li>Sketch out app functionalities and basic layout.</li>
				<li>Find out how to get more than one file's text. How can I make the API list all the files in my folder, then let me open up whatever I choose?</li>
			</ol>

		<h2>February 24: Personal Project Sketches & Testing</h2>

		<p>
			<strong>What is the project's mission?</strong><br>
			The project's mission is to make a phone into a digital magnifier that is more easily usable and inexpensive than protable magnifiers in the market today. Having the phone act as a magnifier also allows the user to limit the amount of gadgets they have to carry around.
		</p>	
		<p>
			<strong>Who is its audience, and what do they value?</strong><br>
			My audience is primarily my cousin, who is low-vision. This can also benefit anyone with vision problems or that is older.
		</p>
		<p>	
			<strong>How will you know if it is successful?</strong><br>
			1. The camera enhancements work well enough to easily maginify text<br>
			2. The extra hardware for it doesn't hinder the phone's portability or ease of movement when reading.<br>
			3. The accompanying app helps in adding features that improve visibility of words and reading in general.
		<p>
			<strong>What is your plan for going about it?</strong><br>
			To get the amount of detail and zoom needed, I'll use a macro-lens to achieve better focus on an iPhone and a buffer or simple stand that can move around on a flat surface. An app will connect to the phone's camera and let the user easily read what the phone is placed on. The app will let you add light with the phone's flashlight, zoom in, and hopefully highlight sentences so that the reader can keep their place.

		<h2>February 16: <em>Pomes</em> changes</h2>

		<p>
			Unfortunately, while I was working on <em>Pomes</em> I didn't commit anything until I made a bunch of changes because I wasn't sure if they'd be going to my Git or not. Things I've done so far are:

			- Replaced all images with my images
			- Changed locations on maps to match where my images where taken
			- Changed all locations for the poems in the code to match to the cities in my images
			- Changed all they typefaces
		</p>

		<p>
			In terms of my research for my personal project, I found a couple of APIs so far that could help em with getting product and menu information:

			- <a href="https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/advertising/api/detail/main.html">Amazon Product Advertising API</a>

			- <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/api/menumix">Menumix</a>

		<h2>February 15: More Personal Project Brainstorming</h2>

		<p>
				<strong>Digital Maginifying Reader for phone</strong><br>
				After doing a bit of research (not very extensively) my conclusion so far is that iPhones do not have the hardware that's appropriate for plaing on top of an object and it being able to focus. I'm tabling this idea unless I'm able to find a way to achieve this in a way that's feasible.<br>
				However, this gave me another spin-off idea...
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Idea - Using QR codes on products to take people to low-vision friendly informational pages on phone</strong><br>
			- If someone who is low-vision or blind wants to be able to read a menu in a restaurant, all menus can come with a QR code that, when scanned, can take a user to a simple site/page on their phone with easy to read text and text-to-speech functionality so that they don't have to struggle with reading small text or making sense of terrible menu layouts.

			- This can also be expanded to any on-the-shelf product too. So many of them have incredibly small text that's actually pretty impprtant to read for the buyer, wether it's descriptive or instructional. If they had a barcode/QR code that can be scanned to take the user to a well-designed, easy to read product page with appropriate features I think it would really enhance their IRL shopping experience.

		<h2>February 10: Brainstorming part deux</h2>

		<p>
			<em>(UPDATE after conversation with cousin)</em><br>
			<strong>Idea 1 - Phone reader for low-vision people:</strong> My cousin uses a <a href="http://www.sightconnection.com/pebble-hd-43">digital magnifying device</a> that helps her read easily when she sets it down on a surface with type. This is very useful, but cumbersome because it's roughly the size of a tablet so it's annoying to transport. They're also usually upwards of $400<br>

			- Is it possible to make an app that does the same function? Maybe one already exists and I haven't found it.<br>
			- It's basically a flashlight and magnifying glass in one.<br>
			- There's already <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/magnifying-glass-light-digital/id406048120?mt=8">an app</a> out there that does the same thing, but either the iPhone construction or camera does not allow for it to be set down on anything so the user has to keep holding it as they read. Could I find a way to incorporate what this does and make it work similarly to a digital maginifying device?
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Idea 2 - App for finding vegan and cruelty-free products (not food):</strong><br>
			- My cousin wants to be able to easily see if a product (beauty and skin-care) is vegan and cruelty-free.<br>
			- It must have a scanner because her low vision causes her to take a longer time having to search by typing something out.<br>
			- Most of the apps I found are either only for searching vegan food products or just cruelty-free products.<br>
			- If she's in Target/Walgreen's/CVS/Sephora and needs to find something quickly, it would be cool if it would be able to tell her immediately by her location what's vegan in that particular store.

		<h2>February 7-9: Brainstorming + <em>Pomes</em></h2>

		<h3>Personal Project brainstorming</h3>
		<p>
			<strong>My dad:</strong> Something involving the space station? News on launches? Sea things? He's a hug fan of marine history and ships.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Both my parents:</strong> A history of Cuba. Family history? - Do I have enough info/memorabilia for this? (update: Dad's going to dig up old photos and letters from his Soviet Russia days).
		</p>	

		<p>
			<strong>Cousin:</strong> She has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_degeneration">Macular Degeneration</a>. Maybe I can develop something specifically to help with this condition? A way for her to see important photos in an easier way?	Need to do additional research to see if there's any visual methods that can be used to help eyesight.<br>
		</p>


		<h3><em>Pomes personalization</em></h3>

		<p>
			I stuck to staying simple and just trying to make a travel diary with it, even though really I don't travel much. Originally I was trying to use the Instagram API to automatically populate images with the locations, but I got scared off by having to register with Instagram as a developer and give a reason in order to do it. For now I'm just e-mailing photos to myself and replacing them manually. I also had to get an Amazon S3 account in order to host my photos.
		</p>

		<p>
			Questions: My S3 URL starts with "s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com" - How can I change it so that it's only "S3.Amazon.com?"

		<h3>1. Concert setting</h3>
		<img width="600" src="http://i328.photobucket.com/albums/l355/laura-guillen/tyler-sketch3_zpsx74qr3sl.jpg">
		<img width="600" src="http://i328.photobucket.com/albums/l355/laura-guillen/tyler-sketch4_zpsgbf2mj23.jpg">
		<p>Tyler seems quiet and introverted at first, but he enjoys going to live shows and he frequents them at least three times a month.
		These ideas place him in a loud concert setting. The first being a background of a concert with strobe lights traveling the page, and the second is his card jumping up and down to msuic from the speakers.</p>

		<h3>2. Pouring beer</h3>
		<img width="600" src="http://i328.photobucket.com/albums/l355/laura-guillen/tyler-sketch1_zpsfukm7dwt.jpg">
		<p>Tyler loves beer a lot so the background of the entire page with his card can fill with poured beer until he's completely immersed in it.</p>

		<h3>3. Record Player</h3>
		<img width="600" src="http://i328.photobucket.com/albums/l355/laura-guillen/tyler-sketch2_zpsi0iqnouf.jpg">
		<p>Tyler enjoys collecting LPs and has a fairly large selection, so maybe his picture can turn into a record being played.</p>

		<h3>4. Data loving + Meticulous</h3>
		<img width="600" src="http://i328.photobucket.com/albums/l355/laura-guillen/tyler-sketch5_zpswwsg5kxt.jpg">
		<p>Tyler also spends a lot of time working with data, so that can be shown with numbers raining down or his picture becoing pixelated.</p>

		<p>He is also a very organized guy who makes lists and pays attention to detail, which is where the idea of a giant magnifying glass came from.
