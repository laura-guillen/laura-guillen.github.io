<h3>1. Concert setting</h3>

<p>Tyler seems quiet and introverted at first, but he enjoys going to live shows and he frequents them at least three times a month.
These ideas place him in a loud concert setting. The first being a background of a concert with strobe lights traveling the page, and the second is his card jumping up and down to msuic from the speakers.</p>

<h3>2. Drowning in beer</h3>
<img width="600" src="http://i328.photobucket.com/albums/l355/laura-guillen/tyler-sketch1_zpsfukm7dwt.jpg">
<p>Tyler loves beer so much that the background of the entire page with his card will fill with poured beer until he's completely immersed in it.</p>

<h3>3. Record Player</h3>
<img width="600" src="http://i328.photobucket.com/albums/l355/laura-guillen/tyler-sketch2_zpsi0iqnouf.jpg">
<p>Tyler enjoys collecting LPs and has a fairly large selection, so maybe his picture can turn into a record being played.</p>

<h3>4. Data loving + Meticulous</h3>
<img width="600" src="http://i328.photobucket.com/albums/l355/laura-guillen/tyler-sketch5_zpswwsg5kxt.jpg">
<p>Tyler also spends a lot of time working with data, so that can be shown with numbers raining down or his picture becoing pixelated.</p>

<p>He is also a very organized guy who makes lists and pays attention to detail, which is where the idea of a giant magnifying glass came from.
