<p>But this is just one of a few ideas going in. Here are the sketches I made as I brainstormed and talked about the card with Alec.</p>

<h3>1. Look at me / Don't look at me</h3>

<p>Alec is a shy and quiet person. He doesn't like to make loud noises, to be involved in physical comedy, to speak in public. So, I thought he'd love having his card sporlighted whenever people mouse over it!</p>

<h3>2. Does a head on a bicycle have consciousness?</h3>

<p>Alec bicycles everywhere. Including off the /people page, to avoid your attention.</p>

<h3>3. Robot on hover</h3>

<p>Alec is something of an extreme person. He keeps a strict, structured, and very full schedule. He can forego sleep and food. He believes in optimal solutions. Is he secretly a robot?</p>
