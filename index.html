<h3>1. Concert setting</h3>

<p>Tyler seems quiet and introverted at first, but he enjoys going to live shows and he frequents them at least three times a month.
This idea came is to place Tyler in a loud concert setting and have his photo change from restrained guy to party dude.</p>

<h3>2. Drowning in beer</h3>
<img width="600" src="http://i328.photobucket.com/albums/l355/laura-guillen/tyler-sketch1_zpsfukm7dwt.jpg">
<p>Tyler loves beer so much that the background of the entire page with his card will fill with poured beer until he's completely immersed in it.</p>

<h3>3. Record Player</h3>

<p>Tyler enjoys collecting LPs and has a fairly large selection, so maybe his picture can turn into a record being played.</p>
